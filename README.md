 # Crystalshot

By Asmilex, Patch and DRUBRoxas for the Jueves JAM, a 3 days long game JAM about Crystals. **Crystalshot** is a multiplayer game in which you have to defeat others by shooting projectiles. Bullets will bounce up to 3 times until they despawn. Be the last one standing on the arena!

## Controls 

Connect an XInput compatible device (i.e. Xbox Controller or DSx/Nintendo controller using a wrapper) and join the session with the `start` button. You can move with the D-pad.

You can shoot projectiles with R1/R/RB while moving the right joystick and parry them with R2/RT/ZR. Dash with L1/L/LB.
